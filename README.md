# SurveyofPublicParticipationintheArts
This is a .csv dataset from the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts addendum to the census.

SPPA data goes from 1982 - 2017. In addition to data such as income and employment, this dataset covers a large range of questions pertaining to people's participation in the arts. Meaning, this data is not about arts institutions - it's about individuals and how they engage in artistic practice. 

For example, "How many times did you paint/go to a jazz concert/make music in the last year?" And many such other questions over 50+ columns of nitty-gritty arts data. 

This data could make a useful counterpoint to show civic engagement in the arts beyond institutions and investment. The downside? The most granular geolocation is FIPS, which is equivalent to counties. So, we'd only be able to generalize our data at the level of counties.
